## Project Description:
(In this assignment we learned what a version control system is, how to set it up and git commands.)

## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. (I learned a version control system is a system that controls and keeps track of files and the history of how they were edited.)
2. (A distributed control system is preferable to a centralized conrol system because the nature of it creates mroe backup copies of work)
3. (Files in a version control system like git can be checked out and modified and then commited with commands like git committ.)
