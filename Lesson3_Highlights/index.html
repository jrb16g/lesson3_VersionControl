            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A version control system is a main repository for project files. It manages different versions of a project file. This allows multiple team members to check files out and make changes. After changes are made members can check the file back in to be updated. It automatically makes notes of who changed a file, when the change was made, what the change was, and merges. A common repository holds the latest files and everyone gets their own version of a file so two users can edit a file at the same time. It also allows users to rever back to an older file.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A centralized version control system utilizes a single server to hold all version of different files. Users can check files out to modify. It comes with some advantages and disadvantages. Some of the advantages are that everyone is able to get an ida of what their project partners are working on and administrators have greater control over things. It also comes with a few downsides. Everything in this type of system is stored in a central server so if it goes down nobody has access to their work. Even worse if the hard drive fails all work is lost. similar problems arrise with a local version control system.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Distributed version control systems come with many advantages and seem to be the preffered system to use. The main advantage is that you minimize the risk of losing everything because your eggs aren't all in one basket. In a distributed version control system instead of checking out individual files clients mirror the full repository. What this means is that there is essentially a working copy of the full project on local computers of clients. So if my local computer fails I can still retrieve work from the server. Also if the server fails things will work the other way and the project can be recovered from my local computer.

                <span class="text-muted">How git works</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Git is a version control system. It works in an efficient way to minimize redundant data while keeping a history or snapshot of how files were changed or checked in or out. If a file was checked but not chages were made insead of saving an entirely new copy with a new time stamp it would link to the newest version. Most operations performed with git are done locally so it's not very heavy on a network and operations go pretty quickly. It also makes work portability great because you can operate and have access to a projects history while offline and then upload changes you made later when online. It is also mostly writes to the server rather than delete so if mistakes are made it's not hard to recover.

                <span class="text-muted">stages and commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Most work on git is done in three simple but important stages. The first is the committed stage. This stage ensures that information is safely stored locally. In the modified stage it is recognized that a change has been made but it has not be safely stored or committed yet. When something is staged that means a modified version of a file is ready to go into your next snapshot. There are also several commands utilized in this process. (git init) will create a subdirectory for your repository files. To begin tracking a file we can use te command (git add filename) This command tracks and stages a file to be committed. If we wish to verify this we can run the command (git status) and it will tell us if the file is untracked. We can use (git commit) to commit a file and add (-m) followed by a comment to save notes. </p>
